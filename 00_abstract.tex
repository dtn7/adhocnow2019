In disruption-tolerant networking (DTN), data is transmitted in a store-carry-forward fashion from network node to network node. 
In this paper, we present an open source DTN implementation, called \dtn, of the recently released Bundle Protocol Version 7 (draft version 13).
\dtn is written in Go and provides features like memory safety and concurrent execution.
With its modular design and interchangeable components, \dtn facilitates DTN research and application development.
Furthermore, we present results of a comparative experimental evaluation of \dtn and other DTN systems including Serval, IBR-DTN, and Forban. 
%Our evaluation considers static communication setups as well as mobile scenarios to investigate the real-world applicability of DTN software, e.g., for emergency communication.
Our results indicate that \dtn is a flexible and efficient open-source multi-platform implementation of the most recent Bundle Protocol Version 7.
